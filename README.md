# glfw

## Leiningen Dependency

`[glfw "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]`

## Introduction

This library provides clojure bindings to the [glfw](http://www.glfw.org/). Care has been taken to offer consistent and complete docstrings.

## Usage

This api mirrors the c api except clojure's true and false are used instead of 0 and 1 and clojure nil is used instead of NULL.
